    <h1>Ethan Marcotte</h1>
    <p>
      I’m an independent web designer, and the fellow who started that whole “responsive design” thing.
      It’s real nice to meet you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I help teams make beautiful sites and services, and ensure they work everywhere. I’ve done it for clients like
      People Magazine, The Sundance Film Festival, The Boston Globe, and many, many others. And I’d love to do the same
      for you.
      So whether you’re a small product team, a cause-driven, socially-minded organization, or a multinational
      corporation: if your next project needs a designer, a front-end developer, or some combination of the two, drop
      me a line! I’d love to work with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve spoken at conferences across the world, including Adobe MAX, An Event Apart, and Webstock. And I frequently
      offer workshops to my clients on a variety of topics, from pattern-driven design practices, to modern
      design/development workflows, to the fundamentals of responsive layout.
      If you’d like to invite me to speak at your conference, or to give a workshop at your company, drop me a line.</p>
    <p>I also have a blog where I occasionally write about responsive design, the web, and everything else under the
      sun. (My most recent entry? That’d be “Notes from a crosswalk.”)</p>
